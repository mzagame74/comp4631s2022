              has proven to provide a host of benefits to human lifestyle and health. IoT
              devices are ushering in a wave of innovation by allowing us to connect nearly
              any device that we might use on a daily basis to a pervasive smart network that
              can be controlled from our fingertips. Also, new wearable and embeddable tech
              makes staying connected even easier and provides great health care benefits.
              For example, the average user is able to monitor their own health, and health
              care providers have access to more tools (such as AR) to offer better care.
              So as long as IoT and wearables remain useful to most users, this emerging
              technology could certainly be here for the long-term.}

  abstract = {Web3 is being coined as the evolution of the internet. However, its aim is to
              take a step back from the over-centralization of the current web 2.0 to the
              early days of the internet which was more decentralized. Essentially, striking
              a balance between web 1.0 and the current internet that is primarily controlled
              by large corporations. This is done by layering blockchain technology onto the
              web to store and transfer data on an encrypted network that is not owned
              nor operated by any one entity. Currently it is too early to tell whether this
              will be possible to implement in a truly decentralized way and on such a large
              scale. However, if implemented, it could forever change the way information
              moves across the internet.}

  abstract = {The market for personal finance applications has been on the rise over the past
              few years and is expected to continue rising at a compounded annual growth rate
              of 6.4\% from 2017 to 2023. The ease of managing your portfolio and monitoring
              your spending right from your mobile device has enticed a new generation of
              investors and people who are less involved with finances to gain more control
              over their financial goals. In order to create a useful personal finance app,
              there are a several important steps that must be taken. Some of these include:
              planning features and a minimum viable product, creating a development roadmap,
              implementing industry-standard or better APIs for a smooth and secure app
              experience, team building and organization, etc.}

  year     = {2022},
  abstract = {In the modern digital age of the internet, it has become
              common for most online services that we use in our everyday lives to keep a
              record of the data that we provide. Large companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc., all use this data to target advertisements towards us in hopes
              to get our attention and ultimately turn a profit. In essence, our data is
              being traded behind the scenes so that these companies can sell us their
              products. But what if consumers were the ones in control of the data that was
              up for sale? While individuals' data is not necessarily all that expensive,
              giving end users the ability to control which data gets shared could lead to
              a more fair and trusted internet advertising market. The idea of data brokers
              would allow for this kind of information exchange and could change the way we access and store information on the internet.}
