  abstract = {Web3 is being coined as the evolution of the Internet. However, its aim is to take a step back from the over-centralization of the current web (Web 2.0) to the early days of the Internet which was more decentralized. Essentially, striking a balance between Web 1.0 and the current web that is primarily controlled by large corporations. This is done by layering blockchain technology onto the web to allow data transfers to be done on an encrypted network that is not owned nor operated by any central authority. Currently it is too early to tell whether this will be possible to implement in a truly decentralized way and on such a large scale. However, if implemented, it could change the way information moves across the Internet forever.}

In essence, our data is being traded behind the scenes so that these companies can sell us their products. But what if consumers were the ones in control of the data that was up for sale? While individuals' data is not necessarily all that expensive, giving end users the ability to control which data gets shared could lead to a more fair and trusted internet advertising market. In the future, data brokers could offer up this kind of information exchange which could largely alter our interactions online.}

However, a more personalized experience comes at the expense of more personal information. This study seeks to determine how willing consumers are to provide personal information at the risk of a breach of their own privacy using the privacy calculus theory. Data was collected via a survey of over 150 people with exposure to IoT devices in a few different areas such as healthcare, smart home, and smart transportation. In summary, perceived benefit was met with more people willing to provide personal information, whereas perceived risk did not significantly impact the data. The exception being IoT in healthcare where privacy risk is high, in which case people were less willing to provide personal information despite the less personalized experience. }

After over a decade of what was known as Web 1.0, Web 2.0 brought in an era of content creators that share and post content on various platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc, which continues to exist to this day. Originally, Web 3.0 was to be known as the Semantic Web, where devices would process and share data contextually and conceptually via machine learning, ideally in an IoT style network. Given the rise of blockchain technology, the focus of Web 3.0 has shifted to democratizing and restoring privacy on the Internet. While Web 3.0 is still being defined, it has the potential to mitigate the issues with the current web and bring about the perfect internet, where users can be both content consumers and creators  without any fear of losing the rights to their digital identity.}

Web 1.0 began in the early 90s and was a static, read-only type of web where users could simply search for and read information off of HTML based web pages. The only people who created content for the web were developers with knowledge of HTML, CSS, etc. Web 2.0 emerged around 2004 and became known as the read-write web. By this point in time users could interact with more dynamic web pages, and through the use of various platforms publish a variety of their own content. However, this web also brought with it the issue of data centralization. Originally, Web 3.0 was projected by Tim Berners-Lee to be the era of a machine-learning based contextual web. This evolution of the web can be thought of as an infrastructure that is made up of many layers. Some of these layers include, the semantic web stack, ontology and relation of data, resource description frameworks, and OWL, most of which are developed by the W3C.}

Currently, users need to sign up for services in order to be identifiable on the web. Corporations being in control of user data is the reason why many are looking into self-sovereign identity solutions for the web. Originally coined by the W3C, a self-sovereign identity is an identity management system where individuals have full control over their digital identity. Blockchain's decentralized consensus mechanisms have the potential to be the solution to online identity management. The three main requirements for a self-sovereign identity are security, controllability, and portability. In terms of the current SSI architecture, four components are analyzed in relation to blockchain tech; these are, identification, authentication, verifiable claims, and attribute storage.}

In the sense of this debate, power is directly related to the control of information. A sovereign view of power establishes the notion that you either have power or something else has power over you, ergo it can be seen as a zero-sum game. Likewise, centralization and decentralization must both exist in a system of equilibrium. However, the centralization of information is more often found towards the top of organizational hierarchies. It is also argued that computers are not responsible for the centralization or decentralization of power, but tend to reinforce the power of dominant actors. Furthermore, organizational information systems are better managed by computers and those who can use computers to their advantage. The article also focuses on how information systems are being developed for use in the National Health Service.}

Intermediaries are responsible for carefully and accurately recording transactions so that everything is in proper order. Blockchain technology aims to overcome the risks involved in these legacy financial situations by replacing trust in people with trust in a complex mathematical structure. Blockchains are an append-only, immutable type of data structure that operates and is maintained by various nodes. Nodes validate information on-chain via a consensus mechanism in which each node must agree on the validity of the block before it is added to the chain. Since blockchains do not rely on third parties to verify information, they are inherently more secure and allow for a trustless transaction of information. Today, blockchain is most commonly implemented in cryptocurrencies. Blockchain, naturally, could play a large role in the financial sector due to its ledger-like properties being able to work in real-time. In the future, innovative entrepreneurs who are willing to work with cryptocurrencies may allow blockchain to flourish.}

Many popular social networking platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Zoom, TikTok, etc., have experienced great increases in user interaction most recently during the pandemic. The increased demand for more bandwidth has brought with it concerns about energy consumption associated with our projected internet usage. Along with existing internet technologies such as video streaming, which reportedly accounts for 45% of all internet activity today, emerging technologies such as AI, machine learning, blockchain, and IoT are likely to raise energy usage considerably more. It is imperative that we are able to accurately measure energy consumption, and to devise solutions that enable devices to be more energy-efficient. While bandwidth fears are becoming more apparent, and justifiably so, it has been deemed incredibly unlikely that bandwidth-heavy activity such as video streaming could ever take down the Internet.}

Many sectors of society have undergone digital transformations which have brought with them both new opportunities and challenges. In many parts of the world, modern institutions and processes lack the ability to keep up with the ethical, legal, and societal issues that emerge from digital technologies. This is the basis for digital governance. In short, digital governance is a framework that helps to manage the risks associate with digital technologies. Digital governance also has many meanings. It is unclear whether new digital technologies will create a need for new governance models or if they will be dependent on existing models. In the case of the Internet, novel governance models such as an organization in charge of the reservation of IP addresses (ICANN) was established. Given the scale and scope of emerging digital technologies, it is probable that path dependencies will need to be avoided. As such, an investment in the interoperability of social sciences and humanities should help bring communities together and foster useful innovations in digital governance.}

The ability for neural networks to process billions of parameters from massive datasets is a huge computational advancement, yet it also comes with huge costs. Running a neural network at such a scale can cost millions of dollars with high energy consumption and carbon emissions. Sourcing energy from solar instead of coal is a more eco-friendly alternative, however this comes with trade-offs that must first be quantified. Thus, a primary focus in the machine learning industry is on efficiency. In most cases, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) have demonstrated that they are more efficient at handling neural network computations than CPUs, given their parallel processing structure and high memory bandwidth. Alongside GPUs, many implementations of Google's TPUs and ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) can also be found. Furthermore, opportunities for hardware innovations are also on the rise. Some hardware companies are proposing lowering precision at the instruction set level in order to skip over unnecessarily small values and boost efficiency. Looking ahead, it is paramount that the acceleration of neural networks is environmentally sustainable.}

The Internet, being publicly open and accessible to anyone, currently serves both beneficial and harmful purposes. Therefore, it is imperative to work towards preserving only beneficial uses and preventing any harmful abuse. Several aspects of the technical infrastructure can be improved to provide better security, such as DNSSEC, two-factor authentication, transport layer security, end-to-end cryptography, stronger identity control, etc. Currently the Internet is fragmented by legal jurisdictions which are subject to control by various governments. If the Internet is to be safe and secure while preserving its openness, cooperation between jurisdictions will be most likely in the decades to come.}

abstract = {Project Natick is the name of Microsoft's deep-sea datacenter project which also fittingly powers the Microsoft Azure cloud service. The datacenter was recently retrieved after having been submerged for two years in the Northern Isles. During this time, Microsoft's team was able to monitor the performance of the data center and found that only 8 of the 855 servers had gone offline. The idea behind the project was to efficiently provide cloud based services to many users within 120 miles of the coast where the datacenter was located. As it turns out, running the servers underwater improves energy efficiency by mitigating heat exchange and keeping the servers cool. Retrieving the data center took a full day and revealed a thin coating of algae and barnacles that had formed on the outside of the datacenter which was then powerwashed and cleaned off. The project's team was impressed to find that the underwater datacenter had a one-eighth failure rate compared to the datacenters on land. In addition, freshwater resources were not disturbed at any point during operation. Going forwards, the team at Microsoft has expressed optimism in continuing to operate their services in the most secure and energy efficient ways possible.}
